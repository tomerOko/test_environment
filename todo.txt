export as a npm private repo

* think what part of the compilation shuld avoid the test files 
** what part are there?

*** for debug compilations
**** i think that while debugging tsc work regullarly just create files that lets the compiller do the maching between ts code and build code
**** shuld not avoid test while debugging


*** for nodemon localy compilation to memory
**** it compile all files that are imported in the root file and run the root file as script -
**** so there is two option 
1: import all script to an 'index' file and have two 'lunch' configurations for the debuggers
**** maybe it isn't common to debug tests?
**** nodemon shuld probably run seperatly for fanctionality run and for test run

*** for build in order to run in production

*** for test runs

* how can i get smarter now?
** meditate
** drink water
** do straches
** eat some carbs - like a cookie or crasunt


nodemon index.ts   = build to memory and run
tsc  = build 
VScode debugg lunch bottum   = build to memory with mapping and run + run the vscode dubbeger interface
jest   = build all .test.ts and imported files to memory + and run jest binaries on them?
